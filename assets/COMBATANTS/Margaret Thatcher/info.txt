Lacking intelligence and political backing Thatcher now roams the tower, seeing you she exclaims:
Poletax can work you just need to give it a chance
What do you mean "piss on my grave in shifts"?
Do i pay taxes? those are for poor people ask them 
Ships wont exist in the future so why not kill half of Scotlands industry?
I wipe my rear with argentina
What the fuck are the falklands?
